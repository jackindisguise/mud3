  DIMENSIONAL SLIP EFFECT

    Riftstalkers can slip between dimensions, gaining enhanced mobility and
  avoidance.

    This passive effect represents riftstalker ability to phase between dimensions, providing enhanced mobility and avoidance. It grants bonuses to agility, avoidance, accuracy, and endurance, as well as reduced incoming damage.

    This effect is automatically applied to riftstalkers and is always active.
