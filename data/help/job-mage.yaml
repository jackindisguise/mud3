  MAGE JOB OVERVIEW

    Mages devote decades to the study of sigils, constellations, and the whispered
  names of elementals. They prize ornate robes over armor, treating each battlefield
  as a living grimoire where new theories are tested in bursts of fire and light.
  Many serve as archivists or advisors until destiny drags them to the front lines.

    Their spellcasting aptitude grows explosively: intelligence and mana expand far
  faster than raw brawn, letting them chain high-cost rituals while staying light
  on their feet. This comes at the expense of strength and resilience, so they rely
  on wards, clever positioning, and overwhelming arcane force instead of standing
  toe-to-toe with heavy hitters.
