  EXEC - Execute JavaScript Code (Admin Only)
  
  Usage:
    exec <code>
  
  The exec command allows administrators to execute arbitrary JavaScript code
  on the server. This is a powerful debugging and administration tool that
  provides direct access to the game's runtime environment.
  
  Examples:
    exec console.log("Hello World")
    exec context.actor.sendMessage("Test", MESSAGE_GROUP.SYSTEM)
    exec return context.room.contents.length
    exec context.game.broadcast("Server announcement!")
  
  Available Variables:
    context - The command context containing:
      - context.actor    - The mob executing the command
      - context.room     - The current room
      - context.game     - The game instance
      - context.registry - The command registry
  
  Return Values:
    - If the code returns a value, it will be displayed as JSON
    - If no value is returned, you'll see "Code executed successfully"
    - Errors are caught and displayed
  
  Security:
    This command is RESTRICTED to admin users only. Regular players cannot
    access this command. Admins are automatically granted to localhost
    connections.
  
  Warning:
    This command can modify game state, create/delete objects, and execute
