  COMMUNICATION - Talking in the Game
  
  There are several ways to communicate with other players in the game:
  
  In-Character (Say):
    Use the 'say' command or apostrophe shortcut to speak to players and NPCs
    in the same room as you. This is for in-character roleplay and conversation.
    
    Examples:
      say Hello, friend!
      'How are you doing?
  
  Out of Character (OOC):
    Use the 'ooc' command or quote shortcut to send messages that are not part
    of the in-game roleplay. These are visible to all connected players.
    
    Examples:
      ooc Hello everyone!
      "How do I find the market?
  
  Key Differences:
    - SAY is in-character, only heard by those in your room
    - OOC is out-of-character, heard by all players online
    - Use SAY for roleplay, OOC for game questions/chat
